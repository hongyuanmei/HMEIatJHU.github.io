<!-- I am a computer scientist.  -->
<!-- I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC).  -->
I train computers to *reason* about the world.

Currently, I am training Grok to be a *knowledgeable reasoner*.
As a core contributor to Grok, I developed the methods that enabled Grok 4 Heavy, which achieved state-of-the-art performance on Humanity's Last Exam.

Before joining xAI, I was a Senior Research Scientist at Google DeepMind.

Before DeepMind, I was a Research Assistant Professor at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC), a research institute affiliated with University of Chicago.
At TTIC, I led the [River Lab]({{ '/lab/' | relative_url }}), conducting research on AI reasoning and planning.

I received PhD in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/).
We developed the neural Hawkes process, a model widely used in event sequence modeling and prediction.


<!-- I develop machine learning methods for reasoning about real-world events. 
My research spans machine learning and natural language processing.
Currently, I am most interested in
- developing neural and neuro-symbolic methods;
- harnessing and improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models;
- building world models that learn from real-world interactions. -->
