<!-- I am a computer scientist.  -->
<!-- I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC).  -->
I develop machine learning methods for reasoning about real-world events. 
My research spans machine learning and natural language processing.
Currently, I am most interested in
- developing neural and neuro-symbolic methods;
- harnessing and improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models;
- building world models that learn from real-world interactions.
