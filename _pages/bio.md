Hongyuan Mei is currently a Member of Technical Staff at xAI, leading the AI Experts Team.
His team and himself have made core contributions to Grok reasoning models, including Grok 4, Grok 4 Heavy, and Grok 4.1 Fast.
They have improved Grok's capabilities to
- reason with expert knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Humanity's Last Exam.
- handle files (e.g., PDF, Excel) in grok.com and Grok for Business.
- call tools and follow instructions, reaching top of τ² Bench.

Before joining xAI, I was a Senior Research Scientist at Google DeepMind.
Before DeepMind, he was a Research Assistant Professor at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC), a research institute affiliated with University of Chicago.
At TTIC, he led the [River Lab]({{ '/students/' | relative_url }}), conducting research on AI reasoning and planning.
Hongyuan Mei received PhD in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/). Hongyuan and Jason developed the neural Hawkes process, a model widely used in event sequence modeling and prediction.

<!-- Previously, he was a Research Assistant Professor at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC), on the campus of University of Chicago. 
<!-- He is broadly interested in developing machine learning methods for reasoning about real-world events.  -->
<!-- His research spans machine learning and natural language processing. 
Currently, he is most interested in 
- developing neural and neuro-symbolic models for time series; 
- harnessing and improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models; 
- building world models that learn from real-world interactions.  -->

Hongyuan's research has been supported by a Bloomberg Data Science PhD Fellowship, the 2020 JHU Jelinek Memorial Award, and research gifts from Adobe and Ant Group. 
His technical innovations have been integrated into real-world products such as Alipay, the world’s largest mobile digital payment platform, which serves more than one billion users.
His research has been covered by [Fortune Magazine](https://fortune.com/2020/09/08/disco-bell-bottoms-big-hair-and-cutting-edge-a-i/) and [Tech At Bloomberg](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/blog/icml-2020-bloomberg-ph-d-fellow-combines-datalog-and-neural-networks-to-model-dynamic-databases/). 

<!-- His research goal is to enable computers to reason about the real world.  -->
<!-- His current focus is to develop machine learning models and algorithms for time series modeling and natural language understanding.  -->

<!-- He was a member of the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP).  -->
<!-- At JHU, he collaborated with Yanxun Xu from Applied Math & Statistics as well as Benjamin Van Durme and Kevin Duh from Computer Science. -->

Before joining JHU, Hongyuan obtained two MS degrees 
<!---(in Physical Science and Financial Mathematics)-->
from University of Chicago, 
and did research in natural language processing with Mohit Bansal and Matthew R. Walter at TTIC. 
Prior to that, he obtained a BE in Electrical Engineering and a BA in Finance from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
